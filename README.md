# Task_8
Elevate Labs Internship Task-8 4th July 2025

In this project, I performed K-Means clustering on customer data from a mall dataset. I first preprocessed the data by encoding categorical values and standardizing features to ensure fair clustering. Then, I used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the data to 2 dimensions for easier visualization. After that, I applied the K-Means algorithm to group customers into clusters and visualized them using color-coded scatter plots. I also used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluated the clustering quality using the Silhouette Score.
